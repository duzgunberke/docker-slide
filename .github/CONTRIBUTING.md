## Contributing
Please keep the [issue tracker](https://github.com/duzgunberke/docker-slide/issues) limited to **bug reports**.


### General Questions and Support
If you have questions about how to use Docker the best place to ask is in the [Discussions](https://github.com/duzgunberke/docker-slide/discussions). Anything that isn't a bug report should be posted as a dicussion instead.


### Pull Requests
- Should be submitted from a feature/topic branch (not your master)
- Should follow the coding style of the file you work in, most importantly:
  - Tabs to indent
  - Single-quoted strings
